## Crumby Atom Syntax

I found comments are to dark in the default theme. I have hacked together a nice theme based on the one-dark syntax.

### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting it from the __Syntax Themes__ drop-down menu.
